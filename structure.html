                            The term "database" is usually used to refer to both a database and the database management system used to manage it, due to the close relationship between them.
                            The term database is often used outside the field of professional information technology to refer to any  â€ƒ
                            set of related data (such as a spreadsheet or an index card set), as the usage and size requirements usually require the use of this database management system.
                            The size, capabilities, and performance of their databases and their management systems have become increasingly important. These performance increases were due to the development of technology in the areas of processors, computer memories, storage and networks. The development of database technology can be divided into three areas dependent on the structure or data model: navigational, SQL / relational, and post-relational.
